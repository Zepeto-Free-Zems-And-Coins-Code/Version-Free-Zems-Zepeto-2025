<ul>
<li>Aside from official in-game events or watching ads, there are few free options for acquiring Zems in large quantities.

<h3>8. <strong>Can I earn Zems through third-party apps or websites?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>It's <strong>not recommended</strong> to use third-party apps or websites that claim to give you free Zems, as most of these are unreliable and can lead to account suspension.

</ul>
<h3>9. <strong>What should I do if I encounter a scam offering free Zems?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you come across any website or app offering free Zems or claiming to generate codes for free Zems, <strong>report it</strong>. Scams can compromise your account and personal data. Always avoid sharing your account information with any unverified third-party services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. <strong>How can I get Zems if I run out of free ways to earn them?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve exhausted the free methods and want more Zems, your best option is to purchase them directly through the <strong>Zepeto app</strong> using the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Sometimes, Zepeto also offers <strong>discounts or promotions</strong> for purchasing Zems, so keep an eye out for those.</li>
</ul>
<h3>11. <strong>Is it worth it to get Zems for free, or should I just buy them?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>It depends</strong> on how much you want to spend and how patient you are. If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting for events or completing tasks to earn Zems gradually, the free methods are fine. However, if you want to unlock premium items quickly, purchasing Zems directly will be faster.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12. <strong>Can I transfer Zems to another player?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No, Zems are not transferable</strong> between players. They are tied to your individual account, so you cannot give or trade Zems with others.</li>
